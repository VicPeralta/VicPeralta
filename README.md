### Hello I'am Victor ðŸ‘‹

I am a C++ developer currently learning Web development at [Microverse](https://github.com/microverseinc).  
I studied electronics but I have always loved to program.  
I have developed applications mainly for Windows using C++, C#, and Visual Basic but I am always learning new tools.
